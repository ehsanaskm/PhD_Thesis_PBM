# Development, Validation and Application of Population Balance Models in Eulerian Approach for Bubbly Flow Reactors


In the present project, the Method of Classes (CM) and Quadrature-based Moments Method (QBMM) are described, implemented and compared
using the developed CFD-PBM solver.

## OpenFOAM

OpenFOAM Version 4.0
OpenFOAM Version 4.1
OpenFOAM Version 4x
