# These are the solvers and cases which I worked on during my PhD study. To understand better the modifications and examples, I would like to recommend you to read the thesis, the papers and a short guide which I prepared for you here.

Thesis:

Modelling of Bubbly Flow Using CFD-PBM Solver in OpenFOAM: Study of Local Population Balance Models and Extended Quadrature Method of Moments Applications

Paper 1:

Modelling of Bubbly Flow Using CFD-PBM Solver in OpenFOAM: Study of Local Population Balance Models and Extended Quadrature Method of Moments Applications

Paper 2:

Application of Extended Quadrature Method of Moments for Simulation of Bubbly Flow and Mass Transfer in Gas‚ÄêLiquid Stirred Tanks


Enjoy!
